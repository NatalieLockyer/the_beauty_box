# Purpose of the Project
The Beauty Box is a ficticious E-Commerce website that sells beauty products and accessories. The website also has make-up tutorial videos and make-up blogs. 
The website has been designed to give the user a great experience, from an attractive and eyecatching website, to filtering our products to see the newly listed items, tips and tricks in our make-up tutorials and blogs containing up to date and intresting information.  

This full stack frame work has been built using the Django framework. 

The Beauty Box, provides its users with 
* A registration page, which will give the user a profile page once complete. The profile page will allow the user to add a profile picture, update their contact/delivery and payment details and also see their previous orders (if any).
* A product page, detailing all our items we have for sale, which can be filtered into many different categories.
* A checkout page, listing the items in their basket and a secure checkout.
* A tutorial page were users can get the latest tips and tricks and instructions on how to apply their make-up.
* A blog page, again with all the lastest tips and tricks, and the most up to date and interesting information.
